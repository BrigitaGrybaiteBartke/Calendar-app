# Calendar App

This is a simple calendar application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to manage tasks by date, providing day and week views for better organization. The application implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and uses json-server to simulate a backend for mock data storage.

### Features

* __Day Page:__ View and manage tasks for a specific day.

* __Week Page:__ Plan and organize tasks for the entire week.

* __Create Task:__ Easily create new tasks with details like task description, date, and time.

* __Update Task:__ Modify existing tasks with ease.

* __Delete Task:__ Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

* __CRUD Operations:__ Full CRUD functionality implemented for seamless task management.

* __Mock Data with json-server:__ Utilizes json-server to provide mock data for development and testing purposes.

### Technologies Used
* __React:__ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* __TypeScript:__ Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
* __json-server:__ A full fake REST API server for development and testing.
